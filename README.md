# LLM_Workflow
A Coding Implementation to Build a Complete Self-Hosted LLM Workflow with Ollama, REST API, and Gradio Chat Interface
###
In this tutorial, we implement a fully functional Ollama environment inside Google Colab to replicate a self-hosted LLM workflow. We begin by installing Ollama directly on the Colab VM using the official Linux installer and then launch the Ollama server in the background to expose the HTTP API on localhost:11434. After verifying the service, we pull lightweight models such as qwen2.5:0.5b-instruct or llama3.2:1b, which balance resource constraints with usability in a CPU-only environment. To interact with these models programmatically, we use the /api/chat endpoint via Pythonâ€™s requests module with streaming enabled, which allows token-level output to be captured incrementally. Finally, we layer a Gradio-based UI on top of this client so we can issue prompts, maintain multi-turn history, configure parameters like temperature and context size, and view results in real time. Check out the Full Codes here. 

We first check if Ollama is already installed on the system, and if not, we install it using the official script. At the same time, we ensure Gradio is available by importing it or installing the required version when missing. This way, we prepare our Colab environment for running the chat interface smoothly. Check out the Full Codes here. 

We start the Ollama server in the background and keep checking its health endpoint until it responds successfully. By doing this, we ensure the server is running and ready before sending any API requests. Check out the Full Codes here.
